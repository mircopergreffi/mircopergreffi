## EP1 - How To Master Any Camera

### Story Information
1. Verbally define exactly what the single shot is going to communicate to the audicence. (E.g.: Sam opens the door to the pitch black room and turns on the light, revealing an alien body).
2. The pace at which you are reading the sentence should match the pace of the shot. The shot should last the same time it takes you to say the sentence. If the shot takes longer, probably it contains more information than it should.

### Movement
1. Moving Camera (hand, gimble, drone);
2. Moving Subject;
3. Moving Environment (snow falling, leaves in the wind, car window, water flowing).

### Visual Beauty
Beauty is what the eyes are generally wired to see: bright objects, colors, movement, faces, bodies, hands.
Build your image to focus on what matters.

#### Light
- Directional Light: needed to understand the shape of objects;
- Everything in the scene should be lighted, even dark areas;
- Edgelight.

#### Lines
Lines are instantly recognizable.
Use them to point the attention.

#### Contrast
Separate background from foreground.
Focus the attention.

#### Color
Bring emotions, highligth attention.
Tinted scene scene, but skin tones should not be altered.

### Cameras strengths

- Phone: unique angles;
- Action Camera: movement;
- DSLR: focus, colors, ligthling.

Tweak your film-making with the strengths and vibe/genre acciociated with your camera.
Embrace your camera strengths.

### Enemies
1. Clipped Hightlights: color-grading these areas just give white/gray;
2. Noisy Shadow: color-grading black areas gives noise;
3. Compression: limited high moving details due to write speed;
4. Sharpening;
5. Over saturaed colors: like clipped highliths;
6. Inaccurate colors: white balance;
7. Unintentional camera shake.

### Signal to Noise Ratio
Light vs random energy noise.

### Color Grading with ZONE System
11 zones from 0 to 10. Every element in the scene have a zone, with an associated percentage of the dynamic range.
